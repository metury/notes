\chapter{Hales-Jewett theorem}

We will now jump to another topic and mainly the Hales-Jewett theorem. This was actually motivated by famous Van der Waerden theorem \ref{van-der-waerden}.

\begin{thm}
	For every $n > 0$ and every finite coloring of integers there exists monochromatic arithmetic progression of length $n$, i.e. $a, a + b, a + 2b, \dots, a + (n-1)b$ for $b > 0$.
	\label{van-der-waerden}
\end{thm}

But the main issue is that this theorem is rather more algebraic and also used in combinatorics. For example we could create an auxiliary hypergraph $H = (\N, \text{all pregressions of length }n)$ so that we are looking at edges.

\begin{topic}{Multidimensional Tic-Tac-Toe}
	Lets consider $\Sigma$ finite alphabet (set). Then $\Sigma^n$ is set of functions $[n] \to \Sigma$ (usually called words). Lets define a hypergraph by the following set. $L \subseteq \Sigma^n$ is combinatorial line if $M \subseteq \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ nonempty and $f: [n] \to \Sigma$ such that
	
	$$
	L = \left\{g | \exists c \in \Sigma \ g(i) = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		c & \text{if } i \in M \\
		f(i) & \text{if } i \notin M
	\end{array}
	\right.\right\}.
	$$
	
	\begin{example}
		Lets have $w = (\{\lambda\} \cup \Sigma)^n$ then lets have $A\lambda\lambda B$ which can either be $AAAB$ or $ABBB$. So formally $M = \{2,3\}$ and $f = AAAB$.
	\end{example}

\begin{thm}{Hales-Jewett, 1963}
	For every finite $\Sigma$ and finite $n > 0$ $\exists N > 0$ such that the chromatic number of $H(\Sigma^n, \text{Lines})$ is at least $n$.
