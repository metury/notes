# Notes

My notes I have contributed to on MFF and also some other $\TeX$ files and notes.

I am using Lua$\LaTeX$ to create all notes. Either you may use some editor as [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) or use `Makefile`s provided inside each folder. For creating all notes you may also use `batch.sh`.
