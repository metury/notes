\chapter{STRING $\in$ NP}

Now we will take a look at recognition of STRING graphs. Mainly that this problem is indeed in NP. We have already shown in the first part that STRING-recognition is NP-hard. The main problem is that some string graphs require representation with exponentially many crossings. Which is not possible to guess in an NP algorithm.

Also we have shown (Schaeffer and Štěfanovič) result that any string graph has a representation with at most exponentially many crossings.

Before we continue lets give us an example of a graph and its STRING representation which can be seen on Fig. \ref{string example}.

Firstly lets define another problem which can be converted from STRING-recognition.

\section{Weak AT-realization}

The \textbf{INPUT} is a graph $G = (V,E)$ and $R \subseteq \binom{E}{2}$. The \textbf{GOAL} is to find a drawing of $G$ where only the pairs of edges from $R$ are allowed to cross.

Note that AT stands for abstract topological and weak means that the pairs do \textbf{not hove} to cross, only they can.

For now the drawing is somewhat basic. That is no edges crosses through a vertex. Vertices are points and edges are curves.

\section{Reduction of STRING-recognition to Weak AT-realization}

For a given graph $G = (V_G,E_G)$ we define the following graph $H = (V_H, E_H)$ and $R$. $V_H = V_G \cup E_G$ and $E_H = \{\{v,e\}, v \in V_G, e \in E_G, v \in e\}$. Lets see an example on Fig. \ref{reduction of strings}. We may see that the graph is obtained by subdividing all edges.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}[main/.style = {draw, circle, thick}, e/.style = {myblue}]
			\node[main] (u) at (0,0) {$u$};
			\node[main] (v) at (2,0) {$v$};
			\node[main] (w) at (0,2) {$w$};
			\node[main] (x) at (2,2) {$x$};
			\node[main] (y) at (1,4) {$y$};
			\draw[thick] (u) -- (v) node[midway, e, below] {$e$};
			\draw[thick] (u) -- (w) node[midway, e, left] {$f$};
			\draw[thick] (v) -- (x) node[midway, e, right] {$g$};
			\draw[thick] (w) -- (x) node[midway, e, below] {$h$};
			\draw[thick] (w) -- (y) node[midway, e, above, left] {$i$};
			\draw[thick] (x) -- (y) node[midway, e, above, right] {$j$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{Original graph $G$.}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}[main/.style = {draw, circle, thick}, e/.style = {draw, circle, fill, myblue}]
			\node[main] (u) at (0,0) {$u$};
			\node[main] (v) at (2,0) {$v$};
			\node[main] (w) at (0,2) {$w$};
			\node[main] (x) at (2,2) {$x$};
			\node[main] (y) at (1,4) {$y$};
			\draw[thick] (u) -- (v) node[midway, e] {\textcolor{white}{$e$}};
			\draw[thick] (u) -- (w) node[midway, e] {\textcolor{white}{$f$}};
			\draw[thick] (v) -- (x) node[midway, e] {\textcolor{white}{$g$}};
			\draw[thick] (w) -- (x) node[midway, e] {\textcolor{white}{$h$}};
			\draw[thick] (w) -- (y) node[midway, e] {\textcolor{white}{$i$}};
			\draw[thick] (x) -- (y) node[midway, e] {\textcolor{white}{$j$}};
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{Graph $H$.}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Creating $H$ from $G$.}
	\label{reduction of strings}
\end{figure}

Lastly we define $R = \{\{\{v, e\}, \{w,f\}\}, \{v,w\} \in E_G\}$.

\begin{claim}
	$G$ is a STRING graph $\Leftrightarrow$ $(H,R)$ has Weak AT-realization.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
	"$\Rightarrow$" Suppose $G$ is a STRING graph. Pick endpoints as vertices and crossings as edge-vertices of $H$. Choose these arbitrary (see Fig. \ref{rightarrow} for an example). The edges will follow the lines in a STRING representation.
	
	"$\Leftarrow$" Suppose $(H,R)$ has a Weak AT-realization. See that $H$ is bipartite. Now represent it by going from the vertex alongside every edge to the edge-vertices of $H$ and almost return to the vertex. See Fig. \ref{leftarrow} for an example. It is easily observable that when lines cross then indeed they need be connected by an edge.

\subsection{Test Weak AT-realization in NP}

Firstly we will write down all our assumption about the drawing we will be using.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item We are on the sphere.
	\item Vertex $v$ is drawn as an open disc $D_v$ (also we will denote $\partial D_v$ as the boundary of $D_v$ and $\overline{D_v}$ as the closure of $D_v$, i.e. $\overline{D_v} = D_v \cup \partial D_v$).
	\item An edge $e = \{v,w\}$ is represented by a curve $\gamma_e$ connecting a point from $\partial D_v$ to a point from $\partial D_w$ otherwise $\gamma_e$ is disjoint from $\bigcup_{x \in V} \overline{D_x}$.
	\item For $e \neq f$ $\gamma_e$ and $\gamma_f$ have distinct endpoints.
\end{enumerate}

We can easily see that these assumption are not restricting since it can be switch to "normal" drawing we are using by shrinking the discs to single points and switch back by expanding the single points.

Now we will proceed with the first part of the algorithm \ref{AT-1}.

\begin{algorithm}[!ht]
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Require $G = (V,E), R \subseteq \binom{E}{2}$
		\State $\forall v \in V:$ choose $D_v$ (so that $v \neq w$ have $\overline{D_v} \cap \overline{D_w} = \emptyset$).
		\State For any edge $e \in E$ incident to $v \in V:$ choose an endpoint of $\gamma_e$ on $\partial D_v$.
		\State \textcolor{mygreen}{$\dots$}
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{NP algorithm for testing Weak AT-realization.}
	\label{AT-1}
\end{algorithm}

Before we continue with the full algorithm we will take a short topological detour to some definitions and facts.

\subsection{Topological detour}

\begin{defn}
	$\mathcal{S} := (\text{sphere}) \setminus \bigcup_{v \in V} D_v$. Which is a compact surface with boundary.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$\mathcal{S}-\text{curve}$ is a curve in $\mathcal{S}$ with endpoints in the $\partial \mathcal{S}$ and no other point in $\partial \mathcal{S}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Two $\mathcal{S}$-curves $\gamma, \delta$ are \textbf{isotopic} (written as $\gamma \sim \delta$) if $\gamma$ and $\delta$ have the same endpoints and $\gamma$ can be transformed into $\delta$ by a continuous deformations of $\mathcal{S}$ which fixes the boundary.
\end{defn}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Example of isotopic and non-isotopic $\mathcal{S}$-curves.}
\end{figure}

\begin{defn}
	For two $\mathcal{S}$-curves $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ the intersection number $i(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is
	
	$$
	\min_{\delta_1 \sim \gamma_1, \delta_2 \sim \gamma_2} |\delta_1 \cap \delta_2|.
	$$
\end{defn}

\begin{fact}
	Let $\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_n$ be $\mathcal{S}$-curves. Then there are $\mathcal{S}$-curves $\delta_1, \dots, \delta_n$ s.t.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\delta_i \sim \gamma_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$,
		\item $|\delta_i \cap \delta_j| = i(\gamma_i, \gamma_j)$ for $i \neq j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{fact}

\noindent
With all these definitions we will choose the following triangulation $T = (V_T, E_T)$ of $\mathcal{S}$:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\forall v \in V: \partial D_v$ has three vertices and three edges of $T$.
	\item There are no other vertices of $T$, the remaining edges are chosen arbitrarily as $\mathcal{S}$-curves, so that $\mathcal{S}$ is partitioned into triangle faces.
	\item Vertices of $T$ do not coincide with endpoints of $\gamma_e, e \in E$ from algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{defn}
	An $\mathcal{S}$-curve $\gamma$ is \textbf{normal} w.r.t. T if
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The endpoints of $\gamma$ are distinct from $V_T$.
		\item Any point where an edge of $T$ meets $\gamma$ is either an endpoint of $\gamma$ or a proper crossing (no touching is allowed).
		\item $\gamma$ does not have two consecutive crossings with any edge of $T$.
		\item $\gamma$ does not cross the same edge of $T$ no more than $(2^{|E_T| + |E|})$-times.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{claim}
	If $G$ has a weak AT-realization, then it has a realization where each $\gamma_e$ is normal w.r.t. T.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
	Take AT with minimum number of crossings. 1. is satisfied by the definition. 2. otherwise minimality is broken (see Fig. \ref{second-before} and \ref{second-after}), 3. again the minimality is broken (see Fig. \ref{third-before} and \ref{third-after}) and lastly 4. follows from GRG1.

\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
	Let $\gamma$ be an $\mathcal{S}$-curve, normal w.r.t T for $e \in E_T: c_e(\gamma) := |e \cap \gamma|$.
\end{defn}

Sometimes when we will be talking about $\gamma_e$ for some $e \in E$ then for $f \in E_T$ we will denote $c_f(e)$ short for $c_f(\gamma_e)$. Also in the context we will sometimes leave out $\gamma_e$ and only have $c_f$ or $c_{uv}$ if $f = \{u,v\}$.

\begin{claim}
	The numbers $\left( c_f(e)\right)_{f \in E_T}$ determine $\gamma_e$ up to isotopy.
	\label{string-claim}
\end{claim}

\subsection{Word equations}

Before we showcase the proof we will show us a quick introduction to word algebra and its equations. We will be considering a finite alphabet $\mathcal{A} = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c}, \dots\}$ and variables $\mathcal{V} = \{X,Y, \dots\}$. Each variable $X \in V$ has prescribed length $l(X) \in \N_0$ and represents a word over $\mathcal{A}$ of length $l(X)$.

\begin{example}
	$\mathcal{A} = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}\}, \mathcal{V} = \{X,Y\}, l(X) = 2, l(Y) = 3$ and the equation is:
	
	$$
	XX\mathtt{a} = XY,
	$$
	
	\noindent where the operation is concatenation. One simple solution is $X := \mathtt{ba}$ and $Y := \mathtt{baa}$.
\end{example}

We may see that having one equation or a whole system of equation is the same. As we can see here:

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}
	L_1 = R_1 & & \\
	L_2 = R_2 & \Leftrightarrow & L_1L_2 \dots = R_1 R_2 \dots \\
	\vdots & &
\end{array}
$$

Also it may be that the size of a solution can be even exponential. But there is usually a repeating pattern. We can examine the following example to see that it is indeed true.

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}
	X_1 &=& \mathtt{a} \\
	X_2 &=& X_1 X_1 \\
	X_3 &=& X_2 X_2 \\
	&\vdots&
\end{array}
$$

\begin{fact}
	There is an encoding ("LZ-encoding") such that for any system of word equations we can in \textbf{polynomial time} (in $\abs{\mathcal{A}} + \abs{\mathcal{V}} + \abs{\text{equations}} + \sum_{X \in \mathcal{V}} \log |l(X)|$) determine if a solution exists and compute the LZ-encoding of the lexicographically smallest solution.
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
	From the LZ-encoding of a word $X \in \mathcal{A}^{\ast}$ we can compute the number of occurrences of any symbol $\mathtt{a} \in \mathcal{A}$ in $X$.
\end{fact}

\subsubsection{LZ-encoding}

Shortly we will talk about the exact LZ-encoding. Firstly for a word $\mathtt{a}_1 \mathtt{a}_2 \mathtt{a}_3 \dots \mathtt{a}_n \in \mathcal{A}^\ast$, the \textbf{LZ-factorization} is an expresion of the form $\mathtt{a}_1 \mathtt{a}_2 \mathtt{a}_3 \dots \mathtt{a}_{n} = \mathtt{b}_1 X_1 \mathtt{b}_2 X_2 \mathtt{b}_3 X_3 \dots \mathtt{b}_n X_n$ where $X_i$ is the longest possible sub-word that also occurs in $\mathtt{b}_1 X_1 \mathtt{b}_2 X_2 \mathtt{b}_3 X_3 \dots \mathtt{b}_i$.

Then for LZ-encoding we replace each $X_i$ with a point to previous occurrence and the length of $X_i$.

\begin{example}
	Here is a simple example of converting a word to LZ-factorization and then to LZ-encoding.
	$$
	\begin{array}{l l l l l l l l l l}
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
		\hline
		\mathtt{a}&\textcolor{mygreen}{\mathtt{a}}&\mathtt{b}&\textcolor{myblue}{\mathtt{a}}&\textcolor{myblue}{\mathtt{b}}&\mathtt{a}&\textcolor{myred}{\mathtt{a}}&\textcolor{myred}{\mathtt{b}}&\mathtt{b}&\textcolor{myviolet}{\mathtt{b}}\\
		\mathtt{a}&\textcolor{mygreen}{X_1}       &\mathtt{b}&\textcolor{myblue}{X_2}       &                            &\mathtt{a}&\textcolor{myred}{X_3}       &                           &\mathtt{b}&\textcolor{myviolet}{X_4}\\
		\mathtt{a}&\textcolor{mygreen}{(1,1)}     &\mathtt{b}&\textcolor{myblue}{(2,2)}     &                            &\mathtt{a}&\textcolor{myred}{(2,2)}     &                           &\mathtt{b}&\textcolor{myviolet}{(3,1)}\\
	\end{array}
	$$
\end{example}

Now we will return back to the claim.

\begin{proof}[Proof of claim \ref{string-claim}]
	To clarify this we must showcase the following two points.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Verify that for every $e \in E$, the numbers $(c_f(e), f \in E_T)$ actually describe a curve $\gamma_e$ normal to $T$, with correct endpoints.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Choose $e \in E$, check that for $f \in E_T$ belonging to $\partial \mathcal{S}$ we have
			
			$$
			c_f(e) =
			\left\{
			\begin{array}{ll}
				1 & \text{if } f \text{ contains an endpoint of } \partial \mathcal{S}\\
				0 & \text{otherwise}
			\end{array}
			\right. .
			$$
			
			\item For every face $t = \{x,y,z\}$ of $T$ we can see that the number of connections from $xy$ to $xz$ is equal to $\frac{c_{xy} + c_{xz} - c_{xz}}{2}$, therefore we must check that the number is in $\N_0$ for every face $t$ and every pair of edges $xy, xz$ and $yz$.

			\item Also we need to verify that this gives a correct curve $\gamma_e$, therefore no loops are present. For which we will use word equations $\mathcal{A} = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}\}$. For every $f = \{u,v\} \in E_T$ we will introduce two variables $X_{uv}$ and $X_{vu}$ for which $l(X_{uv}) = l(X_{vu}) = c_{uv}(e)$. For every face $t = \{u,v,w\}$ and vertex $u \in t$ we will introduce variables $Y_{ut}$ and $Y_{tu}$, where $l(Y_{ut}) = l(Y_{tu}) = \frac{c_{uv} + c_{uw} - c_{wv}}{2}$. The equations will be as follows. For every $\{u,v\} = f \in E_T, f \in \partial \mathcal{S}$:
			
			$$
			X_{uv} = X_{vu} =
			\left\{
			\begin{array}{ll}
				\mathtt{b} & \text{if } f \text{ contains an endpoint of } \partial \mathcal{S}\\
				\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
			\end{array}
			\right.
			$$
			
			\noindent and for every face $t = \{u,v,w\}$ and edge $\{u,v\}$ we will have:
			
			$$
			X_{uv} = Y_{ut} Y_{tv}, X_{vu} = Y_{vt} Y_{tu}.
			$$
			
			\begin{observ}
				If $\gamma_e$ is a single connected curve, the system has a unique solution (all $\mathtt{b}$'s). Otherwise, there is a solution containing $\mathtt{a}$, we can find it efficiently.
			\end{observ}
		\end{itemize}
		\item Verify that for each $e_1,e_2 \in E, e_1 \neq e_2, \{e_1,e_2\} \notin R$ have $i (\gamma_{e_1}, \gamma_{e_1}) = 0$.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Now we will denote $c_{uv} := c_{uv}(e_1) + c_{uv}(e_2)$ and then we will check that correctness as we did before.
			\item Next we also introduce similiar word equations. For alphabet $\mathcal{A} = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c}\}$ and variables $X_{uv}, X_{vu},\\ Y_{ut}, Y_{tu}$ as was defined earlier. Only the length is different, for example $l(X_{uv}) = c_{uv} (e_1) + c_{vu}(e_2)$ and similarly for $l(Y_{ut}) = \dots$.
			
			For the first equations it will be more tricky since we can have both $e_1$ and $e_2$ intersecting $f \in E_T, f \subseteq \partial\mathcal{S}$. Otherwise it is straightforward how it is defined.
			
			For the next equations it will remain the same, which is $X_{uv} = Y_{ut} Y_{tv}, X_{vu} = Y_{vt} Y_{tu}$.
			
			\item Lastly we need to verify $X_{uv}$ has $c_{uv}(e_1)$ occurrences of $\mathtt{b}$ and also $c_{uv}(e_2)$ occurrences of $\mathtt{c}$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


By all these steps we have finished the proof that Weak AT-realization is in NP, because we only need to guess the numbers $c_{uv}(e)$ and add it to the NP algorithm \ref{NP-alg}, because with that we can in polynomial time check it is correct.
